GROUP PROJECT
A Conference Center Cleaning Management System works as follows. Several areas (facilities) in the center need to be cleaned periodically. These facilities include: conference rooms, corridors, reception, etc. All facilities are cleaned once a week, except for the reception which is cleaned twice a week.
Each facility is assigned to one cleaner. However, some facilities are too big to be cleaned by one person, therefore, such facilities are assigned to two cleaners.
Design and implement the solution to this system, so that it can produce reports similar to the screen shot attached.
Project Requirements
1) Each group should have 3 or 4 members.

2) Draw a class diagram that models this particular system.

3) Implement the class diagram drawn using Java. The implemented system must be able to produce the reports shown in the screen-shot attached. Note that, the last report might be different depending on the day of the week the project is run.

4) Your Java code MUST be able to run. It should not contain any syntax errors that prevent it from compiling or running.

5) All input data must be hard-coded into the application to facilitate easy testing, but all reports must be dynamically generated.

6) The project must be uploaded on black-board by the 22nd of November 2019.

How to Package your Work
1) Create a folder and name it your group number. For example, group-1.

2) Create a PDF or MS Word file that contains your group members, your class diagram, and any assumptions you might have made.

3) Place this PDF or MS Word file inside the folder you created.

4) Go to Netbeans and export your project as a ZIP file ( File > Export Project ).

5) Place the generated project ZIP file inside the folder you created.

6) Once you are done, zip your work by right-clicking on your group folder and selecting "Add to archive".

7) Upload the file created to blackboard. (The file will have either a .rar or .zip extension). Only one group member should upload the project.
